# GeoLifeCLEF-2024-LifeCLEF-CVPR-FGVC-Kaggle-Competition-
# Overview
This challenge aims to predict plant species in a given location and time using various possible predictors: satellite images and time series, climatic time series, and other rasterized environmental data: land cover, human footprint, bioclimatic, and soil variables.
# Competition Description
Predicting plant species composition and its change in space and time at a fine resolution is useful for many scenarios related to biodiversity management and conservation, improving species identification and inventory tools, and educational purposes.

This challenge aims to predict plant species in a given location and time using various possible predictors: satellite images and time series, climatic time series, and other rasterized environmental data: land cover, human footprint, bioclimatic, and soil variables.

To do so, we provide a large-scale training set of about 5M plant occurrences in Europe (single-label, presence-only data) as well as a validation set of about 5K plots and a test set with 20K plots, with all the present species (multi-label, presence-absence data).

The difficulties of the challenge include multi-label learning from single positive labels, strong class imbalance, multi-modal learning, and large-scale.

# Motivation

Predicting the plant species present at a given location is helpful for many biodiversity management and conservation scenarios.

First, it allows for building high-resolution maps of species composition and related biodiversity indicators such as species diversity, endangered species, and invasive species. In scientific ecology, the problem is known as Species Distribution Modelling.

Moreover, it could significantly improve the accuracy of species identification tools - such as Pl@ntNet - by reducing the list of candidate species observable at a given site.

More generally, it could facilitate biodiversity inventories by developing location-based recommendation services (e.g., on mobile phones), encouraging citizen scientist observers' involvement, and accelerating the annotation and validation of species observations to produce large, high-quality data sets.

Finally, this could be used for educational purposes through biodiversity exploration applications with features such as quests or contextualized educational pathways.
